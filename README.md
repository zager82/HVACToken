# 🌱 HVACToken — Green Mining through Energy Efficiency

HVACToken is a blockchain-based token that rewards real energy savings in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. It's the first tokenized system to incentivize engineers, installers, manufacturers, and end users to implement energy-efficient technologies.

---

## 🔧 Core Mechanics

- 🔹 **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 HVAC tokens (fixed)
- 🔹 **Base Unit:** 1 token = 10 kWh of energy saved
- 🔹 **Halving:** Every 100M tokens mined, rewards are halved
- 🔹 **Proof of Efficiency:** Based on ISO 50001 standard (bottom threshold)

---

## 📊 Token Allocation

- 🧱 Engineers — one-time reward for designing energy-efficient systems
- 🛠 Installers — one-time reward for verified installation
- 🧑‍💼 Users — continuous mining based on real system performance

---

## 🔗 How It Works

1. 🧮 Real energy savings are calculated via AI & IoT modules
2. 📉 Savings are compared to the base ISO 50001 thresholds
3. 🧾 Data is stored in blockchain → verified = tokens issued
4. 📅 Mining and payouts occur seasonally (heating/cooling season)
